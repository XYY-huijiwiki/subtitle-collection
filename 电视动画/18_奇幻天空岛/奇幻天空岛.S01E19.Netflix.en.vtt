Chief! Tibbie, did you find him?

12

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

18
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

19
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were supposed to find the Chief,

20
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

21
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

23
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So those stars are part of the troupe.

24
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's go in and check it out.
Maybe we'll find the Chief.

25
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dad, the performance of these grandpas
was so boring.

28
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

29
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We should go too.

30
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait, don't go. What kind of performance
do you want to see then?

31
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want to see a super awesome

32
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's easy. We all have superpowers.

33
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

36
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

37
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

38
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can turn the switch on and off.

39
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you stop doing that?

40
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

41

42
00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:22.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

43
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

44
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My hair!

45
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How could you...

46
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't be mad. I'm Hair Growth Star.

47
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll make your hair grow back!

48
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

49
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm Handsome Star.
I can make myself look handsome.

50
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Show me then.

51
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can only do it when nobody
else is around.

52
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dad, can we get our money back?

53
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just think of it as charity.

54
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Will they be able to take care of Chief?

55
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everyone's gone.

56
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then let's go back
and take care of the baby then.

57
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's follow them.

58
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's been too long.
I'll change his diaper.

59
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll feed him.

60
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll trim his nails.

61
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll bathe him.

62
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so handsome. I'll make him laugh.

63
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then... I'll massage him.

64
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Babies feel cold easily.

65
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll tuck you in.
Look at him. He's so cute.

66
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It isn't easy to take care of a baby.

67
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're right.

68
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We need to tend to all his needs.

69
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's getting late.
Let the baby get some rest.

70
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Goodnight, baby.

71
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Finally, they left me in peace.</i>
<i>I'm so tired.</i>

72
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Baby, can't you fall asleep?

73
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll sleep with you.

74
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I'll sleep with you too.

75
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We'll all sleep with you. We're here.
-I'm here too.

76
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'll sleep with you too...
-Me too...

77
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are they sleeping during the day?

78
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe because they're stars.

79
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good boy, don't cry.

80
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is he hungry?

81
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe he wants to dance.

82
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think he's unhappy.

83
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They've fallen asleep. Let's sneak in.

84
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just need to make a complete circle
around the roof with this.

85
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Be careful, don't wake them up.

86
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The rope isn't long enough.
Weslie! When did you get in here?

87
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're leaving.

88
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is so annoying!

89
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let my baby go!

90
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give the baby back to me.

91
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was quick.

92
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not getting him!

93
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go bald!

94
00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no. That was all the hair I had!

95
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go bald even more.

96
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll leave, but I'll be back!

97
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great! Wolffy is gone!

98
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll try to come back again.

99
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right.

100
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The baby seems to be suffering.

101
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think he's sick.

102
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What should we do? We never get sick.

103
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all their fault.

104
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We need to do something.
We can't let them come again.

105
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Careful. We don't want those
grandpa stars to see us.

106
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are there so many traps?

107
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seems like someone's been here.

108
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't come close to the baby!
He's sick because of you.

109
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? The chief is sick?

110
00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go take a look.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Baby, get better soon.

112
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chief... how are you?

113
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You!

114
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chief!

115
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How did you get in here? What do you want?

116
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no! He's got a fever!

117
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What should we do?

118
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Help me get them out of here.

119
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're not going anywhere!

120
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, we must take care of our chief.

121
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Without the chief,
we're not going anywhere!

122
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chief, get better soon!

123
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chief!

124
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chief! We need you!

125
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Since you're so desperate,
I'll let you have a go.

126
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie, do you have any ideas?

127
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why don't we try what Chief
used to do to us?

128
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think they'll hurt the baby.

129
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chief.

130
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The baby must be hungry. Let's feed him.

131
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait! Let me try first.

132
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I bought this online yesterday.
It's high-quality baby food,

133
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Starlight fruit milk.

134
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's nutritious.

135
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi, what are you doing?

136
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't worry, there's more.

137
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was getting better.
Why is he sick again?

138
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know someone who can help.

139
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you all fall into my trap,
I'll take the baby away.

140
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you doing?

141
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please don't! I don't have any hair left.
Leave my hair alone.

142
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's okay, I can help.

143
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll make your hair grow back!

144
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you want?

145
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolffy, Chief is sick.
Could you take a look at him?

146
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why should I help you?

147
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy.

148
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Yes. Come after me. Fall into those traps.</i>

149
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy, wait.

150
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How about this? If you cure the baby,
I'll give you our most precious gift.

151
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Precious gift?

152
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Elder, are you sure?

153
00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Elder, don't do it.

154
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a deal. Let's go.

155
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no!

156
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's even more anxious than we are.

157
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where's the milk for the baby?

158
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's with Paddi!
Wolffy, we've already done all that.

159
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know why he's sick.
It's because of that!

160
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolffy, that's nonsense!
Why would I do anything to Chief?

161
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't mean you.

162
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I meant this.

163
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Starlight fruit milk?

164
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How could it be?
I drank a lot of it and I'm fine.

165
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This starlight fruit milk
is from outer space.

166
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Babies can't drink it.

167
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just change it to normal powdered milk
and he'll be fine.

168
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The baby is fine now.

169
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great!

170
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Elder, where's my gift?

171
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure. I'll get it for you.

172
00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy, this is our gift.

173
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you happy?

174
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We want one too.

175
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess you're not bad people after all.
We'll let you stay.

176
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But, Wolffy, keep your hands off the baby.

177
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why should I?
