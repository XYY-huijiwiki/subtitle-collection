So you ate the fruit from the
tree and became small?

8
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Those are infantilising fruits.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Grandpa Elder. The chief
is actually an adult, not a baby.

14
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

15
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

How old is he?

16
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's in his 80s.

17
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's still very young. I'm more than

25
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's because his superpower
is to make people old.

26
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

27
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's always alone. It's hard to find him.

28
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

33
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Um, I think there's a photo of him

34
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

35
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

36
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's because his superpower is to make
himself handsome when no one's around.

37
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What can I do to those stars

38
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

42

43
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

44
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are so many people

47
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

48
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

49
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

doing at the senior activity center?

50
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

51
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

52
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Senior activity center?

53
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So old people love
senior activity centers.

54
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

55
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The stars will be at the center
all the time.

56
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then I'll have lots of time

57
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

73
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at the facilities. It's so...

74
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't it amazing?

75
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's mediocre.

76
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

79
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By the way, is the baby
still feeling unwell?

80
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

81
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

82
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

83
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll let you have him then.

84
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

85
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The little goat has a mark.
You must have one too.

86
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

88
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

89
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

90
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not used to having someone looking
when I'm examining people.

91
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's okay, I'm not looking at you.

92
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

93
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you will distract me.

94
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll leave then.

95
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

96
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's okay.

97
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If he's okay, I'll take him then.

98
00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. He's not okay.

99
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did you say?

100
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I get anxious,

103
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, he needs some rest.

104
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop holding him everywhere you go.

105
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What should I do with my hair?

106
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me help you. Shorter hair!

107
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My hair!

108
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

109
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

If I hadn't asked Handsome Star to go
to Wolffy's senior activity center,

117
00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the photo wouldn't have flown
away and it wouldn't have gotten dirty.

118
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
