9
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You refuse to eat it but open your mouth.

12
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

13
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

22
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

53
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

69
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

71
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
