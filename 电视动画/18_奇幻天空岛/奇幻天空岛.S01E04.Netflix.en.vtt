Paddi, you should go back to the factory
to help out.

10

13
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Weslie and some of the staff

15
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

18
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

23
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

28
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

29
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

32
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

35
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is a portable weather fruit cleaner
I invented.

36
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't it awesome?

37
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are right to worry.

38
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But didn't your remote control wings
save my life before?

39
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The ones I used to save you
were second generation wings.

40
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have improved it
and made the third generation wings.

41
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the manager won't let me test them.

42
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can test them by delivering
the weather fruits, can't we?

43
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What if we drop the weather fruits
when we try? That's dangerous.

44
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's test them with small weather fruits.
It won't be dangerous then.

45
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You said small weather fruits.

46
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You didn't have to bring so many, did you?

47
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fine.

48
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A bigger load can test

49
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if the wings are capable of delivering
larger weather fruits.

50
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fine then.

51
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It works!

52
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look.

53
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The director's remote control wings
are wobbling in the sky.

54
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The remote control wings are crashing.

55
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't worry. Let me adjust them.

56
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You adjusted too much. Go right...

57
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay... Go left... Why is it going up?

58
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, no! It's crashing into a wall!
-Oh, no! It's falling! It's crashing...

59
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After working hard all morning,
it's my happy lunchtime again.

60
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Waiter, please give me a lunch set.

61
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

62
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The plump rice grains,
the crunchy and fresh vegetables,

63
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with a bit of refreshing carrot,

64
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the rich aroma
with a slightly burned smell...

65
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Burned?

66
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's going on?

67
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who threw firecrackers in the canteen?

68
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come to me!

69
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

70
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hope, why did you throw firecrackers?

71
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Boss, we didn't throw firecrackers.

72
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We were testing out
the new remote control wings.

73
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hope, your idea is great.

74
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I told you not to test
the remote control wings anymore.

75
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at what you've done to the canteen.

76
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Boss, I know I was wrong.

77
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I screwed up again.

78
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You just wanted to help out.

79
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's hard to operate
the remote control wings properly.

80
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right! Since manual control
is prone to error,

81
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we can control it
with the computer instead.

82
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With the computer?

83
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can write a computer program
to control the wings.

84
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There won't be any error then.

85
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you writing a computer program?

86
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, we want to write a program
to control the wings.

87
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's so hard to write
a computer program.

88
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it's so simple.

89
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know how to write one?

90
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's so surprising about that?

91
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Other than programing, I know karate,
playing the piano, surfing, and DJ-ing.

92
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you help us then?

93
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course... not.

94
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why not?

95
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What if an accident happens again?

96
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi, let's continue.

97
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I heard you catch a cold.
I brought you soup.

98
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I hope you'll get better soon.
-Thank you so much, Director.

99
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's wrong.
You should press this button.

100
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me handle it.

101
00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's done.

102
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, the remote control wings
can be controlled electronically.

103
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you!
-It's fine... It's just a small matter.

104
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

105
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

106
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie, I have great news.

107
