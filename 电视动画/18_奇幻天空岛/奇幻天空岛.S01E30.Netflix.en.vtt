57

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But then you disappeared all of a sudden.

94
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You left so you could do bad things,

95
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was because...

96
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

97

I've been busy lately.
We'll play another time.

98
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ever since you started managing
the Cloud Sea tunnel,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you stopped playing with me.

100
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was that why you took the sky crystal?

101
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So that the waterspout would vanish?
-Yes.

102
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Still,
you shouldn't have taken the crystal.

103
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Understood?

107
00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

108
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't understand. Dicky
was a different color in your memories.

109
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

110
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
