15
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, Auntie Bowie.

16
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My name is Weslie. There's something...

17
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I'll be right back.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Auntie Bowie, I would like
to ask about my friends...

19
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here, hold this.

20
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't hold back. Eat as much as you like.

21
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Umm, I'd like to ask...

22
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't talk when you're eating.

23
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on. Let's dig in together.

24
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Auntie Bowie, I would like to...

25
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you like some dessert?

26
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No... I just want to know
where my friends are.

27
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Friends?

28
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
These are my friends. Have you seen them?

29
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. When I saved you, you were alone.

30
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Afterward, I didn't see any goats.

31
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really? Would they have been captured
by Wolffy?

32
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must go and find them now.

33
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't run around when you can't fly.

34
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our Tower Town is 5,000 meters
above the ground.

35
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What? Five thousand meters
above the ground?

36
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Village Chief and the rest must be
in danger then.

37
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Calm down!

38
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They must have fallen
into other cloud cities just like you.

39
00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Other cloud cities?

40
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This sky has many other cities
on the clouds.

41
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These clouds are very strong.

42
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your friends will be fine
even if they fall on the clouds.

43
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a relief then.

44
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is there a way
to get to other cloud cities?

45
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to ask
our mechanical master for that.

46
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are in the clouds. This is great!

47
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dad...

48
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dad... look. I'm the village chief now.

49
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look, me too.

50
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right.

51
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wilie, go and play.
Dad and I have something to talk about.

52
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy, come with me.

53
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolffy,
how did my birthday party go so wrong?

54
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolnie, consider this as a family event.

55
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look, I'm Paddi now.

56
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want to go home!

57
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But Sirius is gone.

58
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want to go home!

59
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fine, I'll figure this out.

60
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Auntie Bowie, can we go now?
-I'm coming...

61
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is so cute.

62
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go!

63
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Auntie Bowie, there's a thief over there.

64
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no one there.

65
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie, did you see something?

66
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go.

67
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're new here,

68
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so there are three things
you must remember.

69
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are they?

70
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
First, never judge us.
Birds are bad singers.

71
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The singing is horrible.

72
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did you say?

73
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beat him! Don't let him get away!

74
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Second, watch out for loose clouds...

75
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's going on?

76
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
...as well as the cloud-pressing trucks
that solidifies cloud surfaces.

77
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lastly, never bully young birds.

78
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Their mothers are very scary.

79
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you looking at?

80
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Haven't you seen a handsome wolf before?

81
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will be back!

82
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've arrived. The master lives here.

83
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Master!

84
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got the wrong guy.

85
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
His name is Potato.
He's the master's assistant.

86
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Master is over there.

87
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's the master?

88
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Auntie Bowie, I saw him
stealing spare parts just now.

89
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've misunderstood.
Master was merely collecting scraps.

90
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Auntie Bowie, who do you have there?

91
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
His name is Weslie.
He got separated from his friends.

92
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could you help him get to
other cloud cities?

93
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This looks familiar.

94
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have you seen them?

95
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have the same pair of glasses
as this goat.

96
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't make jokes. Please help Weslie.

97
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure, no problem.

98
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie, Master has agreed to help you.

99
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Potato, I'll hand Weslie over to you.

100
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bro, if you want to go
to other cloud cities,

101
00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
just take my big plane.

102
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where's the big plane?

103
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's right here.

104
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The plane is too big,
it's covered in clouds.

105
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's wrong?
-It's fine... My plane is under repair.

106
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How long will that take?

107
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's still 365 days away from being ready.

108
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I had better find
another way to leave this place.

109
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait.

110
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My plane has many functions.

111
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It can accurately find
your friends' location.

112
00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you sure you still want to leave?

113
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that true?

114
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course. Let me give you a tour.

115
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why is the toilet right
next to the entrance?

116
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is not the toilet.
This is my cockpit.

117
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come. Look.

118
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is an extra seat.

119
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And this is my pilot seat.

120
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It might look shabby,
but it comes with a seatbelt.

121
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Its only weakness is it's tough to tear.

122
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you like to try?

123
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, thanks.

124
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This lollipop is actually
the steering stick.

125
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't this too primitive?

126
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can't help it.
We don't have enough spare parts.

127
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm sure
the next function will impress you.

128
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me ask you.

129
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's the most important function
of a plane?

130
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The autopilot system?
-No.

131
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The most important function is
of course, karaoke.

132
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Trips can be boring.
How can we not have entertainment?

133
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where's Weslie?

134
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Master is unreliable.

135
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Weslie, there're still a lot of functions
I haven't shown you yet.

136
00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I get Sirius back,
you birds will be in trouble.

137
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sirius!

138
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened to Sirius?

139
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is this?

140
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why am I so unlucky today?

141
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What now?

142
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A plane? This is great!

143
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can take Wolnie and Willie home.

144
00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But this plane is a bit strange.

145
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never mind. I'll fix it after flying home.

146
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It even has this function.

147
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Awesome! Let me get Wolnie while I sing.

148
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie, here you are.

149
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's go back.
I'm not done introducing the plane yet.

150
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But...
-My big plane is fantastic.

151
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not only big,
but can also fly very fast.

152
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See how fast it's flying?

153
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is my plane flying?

154
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go after it.

155
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't reach the plane at all.

156
00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't worry. I used spare parts that fell
from the plane and made a sucker gun.

157
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Awesome!

158
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Safe landing. Let's go in.

159
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So Weslie is here too.

160
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I shall capture you as well.

161
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where's the weapon?

162
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not singing anymore?

163
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sing? I have to catch the goat.

164
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who are you? How long have you been here?

165
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am Donald Potato.
I've heard you sing three songs.

166
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why didn't you say anything then?

167
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because Auntie Bowie said
not to talk when you're eating.

168
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you talking now?

169
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because I finished my food.

170
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy!

171
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy, hand the plane back to Master.

172
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is my plane.

173
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't you try and take it away.

174
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take that!

175
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm the real owner of this plane.
Potato, pour the oil.

176
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Goodbye, Mr. Wolffy.

177
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here, this is yours.

178
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so glad to see you've become friends.

179
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dig in. I'm going now. Goodbye.

180
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Master, you're amazing.

181
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is your plane still so shabby?

182
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's because Tower Town have
too few spare parts.

183
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Master, I found some spare parts.

184
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't this from the magic train?

185
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
