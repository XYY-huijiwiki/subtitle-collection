Tibbie, what do you think
of the new Magic Train?

10
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's amazing. I didn't expect the magic
train to have a morphing function.

11
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And my happy skill is so special.
It's so much fun.

12
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks like each of us has a different
skill when operating the Magic Train.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

15
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Weslie, you promised to take us out
for a picnic. Let's get going.

16
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have you packed everything that's needed?

17
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fine, I'll help you pack up.

18
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, Leader.

19
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

20
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

21
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I almost forgot to close the door.

22
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've finished packing.

23
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got more stuff than you.

24
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got the most.

25
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Leader, the job of creating
the rainbow is on you.

26
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, you guys go have fun.

27
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tibbie, will you be all right alone?

28
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't worry.
We've taught her how to do it.

29
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it's all written in the book.

30
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does she have to read the whole book?

31
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, that's just the catalog.
The books are here.

32
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have a parcel. Is anyone home?

33
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hi, is Tibbie here? These are for her.

34
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tibbie, what did you buy? It's so heavy.

35
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are tools and ingredients

36
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm making delicious bread tonight.

37
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great.

38
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so smart. I got in so easily.

39
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me catch Paddi first.

40
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi, let's get going.

41
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Leader, remember to lock the door.

42
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh. The cabinet is rusty. Can you help me
take it to the recycling point?

43
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sure.
-Sure.

44
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sounds like Tibbie will be alone.

45
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What a good opportunity.
Oh no, what's going on?

46
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Come on...
-Come on...

47
00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why isn't it moving anymore?

48
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Push.

49
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh...

50
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Push harder.

51
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cabinet's rolling downhill!

52
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's so hot.

53
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everyone, steer clear!

54
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cabinet's rolling downhill.

55
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Since everyone's all right, let's go.

57
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go!

58
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait, was this lock here?

59
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never mind. I'll open it.

60
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This lock is no joke.

61
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I'll open it.

62
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How many more traps are there?

63
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What a waste of my efforts!
The back door wasn't even locked.

64
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is so mean!

65
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Inject energy before the launch.

66
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
After that...

67
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks like it has stopped raining
in some areas.

68
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must launch the rainbow now.

69
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I remember that the color pens
must be loaded first.

70
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
First, it's red... then orange,
yellow, green, indigo, blue, and violet.

71
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Next, I have to inject energy.

72
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The injection is done.

73
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

75
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And angle, 40 degrees. Start charging now.

76
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fully charged.

77
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Launch the rainbow!

78
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's the fuss?

79
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What... What's going on?

80
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When youngsters create a rainbow

81
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
there's bound to be some mistakes.

82
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Exactly...

83
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did I do something wrong?

84
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I got the temperature and wind
speed mixed up.

85
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me do it again.

86
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Humidity, 54 degrees.

87
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Temperature, 36 degrees. Wind speed,

88
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Start charging now.

89
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ready for launch!

90
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It should be all right this time.

91
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I forgot to adjust the angle.

92
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The angle is 40 degrees. What's wrong?

93
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is it so hard to adjust this?

94
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh no, it's tilted. What should I do?
I can't adjust it anymore.

95
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, I can use the Magic Train
to align the crystal.

96
00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm so tired after searching
through the rooms. Where is Tibbie?

97
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Freeze, hands up!

98
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This room is so weird. What's this?

99
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's strange. What is this?
Let's try doing this.

100
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Whoever blinks first, loses.
-Okay...

101
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The shape of the rainbow is getting weird.

102
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tibbie is creating a rainbow
for the first time,

103
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it's normal to have some hiccups.

104
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You call this normal?

105
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, it's normal.

106
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's normal for the rainbow
to make faces at us?

107
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, it's normal.

108
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Time's running out. I have to align
the crystal quickly.

109
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy? Why...

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
why are you here?

111
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Little goat, I've been searching for you.
You've finally come to me.

112
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's sitting inside the Magic Train!
I have to lure her out.

113
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you trying to do?

114
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Trying to catch you.

115
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was always the wolf catching the goats
in previous episodes. Okay?

116
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anyway, I can't let you make trouble here.

117
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Again?

118
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oops, you missed it. If you have guts,
don't hide in the Magic Train.

119
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's too cramped here.
I might hit the machine.

120
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then come down and catch me.

121
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a joke! Get out of here right away.

122
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm staying. What can you do?

123
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Stop it, Wolffy!
Or else I'll throw you out.

124
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? I'm so scared.

125
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You won't be able to catch me
if you're hiding inside the Magic Train.

126
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop it!

127
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got you!

128
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me go!

129
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The claws are so big.
How can you catch me?

130
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh no, the claws are too big.
What should I do now?

131
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I must be strong.

132
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got an idea.

133
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tibbie, are you tired?
Come down and get some rest here.

134
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

135
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your tricks don't work on me at all.

136
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is my skill.

137
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll keep dancing
as long as I play this.

138
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My waist... Tibbie...

139
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keep on dancing. Don't stop.

140
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop... Stop it.

141
00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I... can't... take this anymore.

142
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The crystal column is finally aligned.

143
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's about time. I must be quick.

144
00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's finally over. I'm too tired to move.

145
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will be back!

146
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I finally got it right this time.

147
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're back.

148
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Welcome home.

149
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We saw it on our way home.
The last rainbow you created was pretty.

150
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tibbie, although the first few
were a little weird,

151
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you created a proper rainbow in the end.

152
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's right.
The last rainbow was very pretty.

153
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

154
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, I'm hungry.

155
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have some bread now.

156
00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you ate the most during the excursion.
How could you be hungry?

157
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry. I haven't had time
to make the bread yet.

158
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's fine. You've worked hard today.
We'll make the bread.

159
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have us...

160
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And me too.
-And me too.

161
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You guys... let's do it together.

162
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.
