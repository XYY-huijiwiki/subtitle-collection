39
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

or we won't make it!

46

Yes, we will make it!

49
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

53
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

54
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

59
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

not clean.

60
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sir, according to order 1200,

63
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

67
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Disregard the rule of following
orders by sequence.

68
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

69
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
According to the rules, you have to finish
one order before moving on to the next.

70
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

by the time you're done.

73
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

74
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

77
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

2016? I can get the goats after this.

80
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's do it!

81
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The temperature of
the stratosphere remains constant--

82
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

83
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

84
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just stirring it to cool it down.

85
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good. There's half a cup left.

86
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

88
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no. What's with this storm?

89
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop!

90
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just a drill.
We don't need to go all the way.

91
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We take drills seriously.

92

Congratulations. You've completed this.
Now let's--

93
00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's get the goats!

94
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's proceed to round two of the drill.

95
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Round two?

96
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Turn on the fan.

97
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why does it have to be so strong?

98
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
General. The wind is too strong.

99
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shall we stop for now
and continue tomorrow?

100
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. Once I'm done with this,
I can go catch my goats.

101
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We mustn't stop. Sirius!

102
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're safe now.

103
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's as quick as General Balloon!

104
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bravo!

105
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Order 2017, bring the goats here.

106
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, sir!

107
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why did the eye of the storm become
so small all of a sudden?

108
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe there was a shock to the base of
the cyclone, so it's out of control.

The base of the storm?
Was it because of that experiment?

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We need to tell Wolffy about

Do you have something to tell me?

112
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
According to order 2017,

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

114
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, why?

115
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

117
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

There are more important things to do now.
A storm is coming.

121
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

122
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was close. Oh, no! Wolnie and Willie!

124
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
