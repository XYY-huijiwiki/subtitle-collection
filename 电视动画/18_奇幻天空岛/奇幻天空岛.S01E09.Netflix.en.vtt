51
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These cakes aren't similar
to the ones my grandma used to make.

52
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

53
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Those cakes had a numbing taste.

54
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But these cakes don't have that.

55
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't know cakes could

58
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Taste this.

59
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A taste of my peppercorn cake
will be numbing enough!

60
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This flavor isn't right!

61
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My cake is full of unripe bananas.
I guarantee your tongue will be numb.

62
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

63
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then eat the two together
for maximum numbness.

64
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait, the dough is too thick.
It won't mix.

65
00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

67

but I should make the cake myself.

68
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's no good. We said

88
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you shouldn't force my son
