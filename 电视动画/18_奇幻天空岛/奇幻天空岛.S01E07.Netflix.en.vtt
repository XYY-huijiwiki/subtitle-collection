00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

13
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

14
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if you take your medicine on time,

15
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

17
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paddi, listen to the doctor
and take your medicine.

18
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Exactly! You'll feel better afterward.

19
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Doctor, I've caught a cold.
Can you give me some medicine?

21
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just take this pill and your sickness

22
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't want medicine!

Paddi.

24
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So amazing!

25
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Who knew my nose would clear up
just after taking the medicine.

26
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The medicine is clearly very effective.

27
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course. If you take your medicine,
you'll be fine in two days.

28
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Doctor, why didn't you say it earlier?

29
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But no worries,
I'll go explain it to Paddi now.

30
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi, I'm telling the truth.

31
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This cold medicine is really effective!

32
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You'll recover very soon if you take it.

33
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, fine.

34
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to sleep now. I'll take it later.

35
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, rest first then.

36
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've put the pills on the table.

37
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Remember to take it when you wake up.

38
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not gonna take it.

39
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That patient had such a crazy reaction
after taking it.

40
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thinking of it makes me scared.

41
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How is Paddi doing?

42
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks like
he's still unwilling to take it.

43
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh no, we're in trouble.

44
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are still
1,000 incomplete fruit orders.

45
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And now Paddi is sick. What should I do?

46
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How about I go explain to the customers,

47
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
see if we can give them
a partial order first?

48
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fantastic!

49
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The weather fruit got here on schedule.

50
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How come there're so few?

51
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm so sorry.
There's a situation at the factory.

52
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please use these first.

53
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's hard to keep my business going
without enough weather fruits.

54
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My deepest apologies.
We'll deliver the rest in two days.

55
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I see.

56
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, you promised, two days.

57
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hello, is anyone there?
I'm here to deliver the weather fruits.

58
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you send the wrong package?

59
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I ordered more weather fruits than this.

60
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry,
there's a problem at the factory.

61
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll deliver the rest in two days.

62
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mum... I want ice cream.

63
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We don't have enough weather fruits now.

64
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How about we have some in two days?
I'll see you again.

65
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll deliver the rest as soon as I can.

66
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've finally dealt with the customers,
for now.

67
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the rest needs to be produced
in two days. What should we do?

68
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, Weslie.

69
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll think of something for the rest.

70
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why don't you go check on Paddi?

71
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder if Paddi's cold recovered or not.

72
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Turns out Paddi didn't take a single pill.

73
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi, get up and eat candy.

74
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you don't eat it, I will.

75
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>No way. No reaction from him at all.</i>

76
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How refreshing!

77
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Turns out the pill
is just like mint candy.

78
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where did Paddi go?

79
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Excuse me, have you seen a goat
come here to buy snacks?

80
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I haven't.

81
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have you seen a goat
about this high and a little chubby?

82
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi!

83
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi, where are you?

84
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi!

85
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi!

86
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi!

87
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you looking for me?

88
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, wrong person.

89
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi!

90
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go look somewhere else.

91
00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

92
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi!

93
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi!

94
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi, where did you go?

95
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could it be that
he was captured by Wolffy?

96
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't worry...
We will definitely find him.

97
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just in time.

98
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How could he hide and sleep here?

99
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie, look over there.

100
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weather fruits?

101
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
995, 996, 997...

102
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just missing two rain fruits
and a wind fruit,

103
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then the orders are all complete.

104
00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone will be so surprised
when they find out.

105
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
998, 999...

106
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keep it up, Paddi!

107
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One thousand! Finished!

108
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi! You finished all the orders alone.

109
