00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? Paddi ate the last weather seed?

9
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at his head. It has sprouted.

10
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's never been a case
of a weather seed growing on a person.

11
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi, do you feel anything different?

12
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel dizzy.

13
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could it be a side effect
from the weather seed?

14
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. Based on my years of experience,

15
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi is probably just dizzy from hunger.

16
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie knows me best.

17
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look. He's feeling energized now.

18
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A bit of pepper will be perfect.

19
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

20
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi, what's that on your head?

21
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A wind fruit grew on your head!

22
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way.

23
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Who knew Paddi's sneeze
would yield a wind fruit?

24
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could we get other fruits
if Paddi did something else?

25
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's give it a try.

26
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see. Sweating gives us rain fruit.

27
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What if he sweated more?

28
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi, keep running. Don't stop.

29
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It worked. The more he sweats,
the bigger the fruit is.

30
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me make you a gigantic rain fruit.

31
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

32
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Snoring gives us thunder fruits.

33
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're running low on weather fruits.

34
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we don't get more soon,
we'll be in big trouble.

35
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, more and more orders are on hold.

36
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't worry, everyone.

37
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have a temporary way
of producing weather fruits.

38
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Leave it to me.

39
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do your best, Paddi.
I'll be with you the whole time.

40
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, let's begin.

41
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keep it up, Paddi. Keep going!

42
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is strange. Where did Weslie go?

43
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is there a telescope here?

44
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hope, have you seen Weslie?

45
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I haven't, not today.

46
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

47
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

48
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I haven't seen you all day.
Have you been sleeping?

49
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Didn't you say you'd be with me?

50
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm doing all the hard work here.

51
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm starving.

52
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me buy some food first.

53
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie, get up. It's time for dinner.

54
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello.

55
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me take your mark energy,

56
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and turn you into a goat feast.

57
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

58
00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie! Weslie, wake up!

59
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you're awake.

60
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I... I'm not. Look, I'm asleep.

61
00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn't have caught Weslie

62

63

64
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Weslie exhausted himself
trying to help you.

65
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
