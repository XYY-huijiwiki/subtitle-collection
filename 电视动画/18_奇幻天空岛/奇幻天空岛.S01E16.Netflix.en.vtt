A marathon competition?

9
00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:09.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fantastic.

10
00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I wear my new invention, electric
shoes, I'll be able to catch the goats.

11
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I run in them, they'll give off
electricity to attack the goats in front.

12
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right after knocking the goats out,
I'll go over and help.

13
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That way, I can get all the goats
under everyone's noses!

14
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

15
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why do I get electrocuted every time

16
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was the only one who couldn't complete
the marathon last time.

17
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will finish it this time!

18
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

19
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't. This is as far as I can go.
I can't make it after all.

20
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I run at this speed,
I won't get electrocuted.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

22
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

23
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Marathons are so tiring.

24
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll just pretend to run on that day.

25
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That'll be enough.

26
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

27
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

28
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a stroke of luck.

29
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Though my electric shoes
aren't working well, I've found the goats.

30
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

33
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

34
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

36
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

37

39
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

40
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

42
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

All right. Come to my place tomorrow.

48
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, sir!

49
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, listen up.

50
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For the first part of the training,
buy me all these things.

51
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you waiting for? Go!

52
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, sir!

53
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Finally, I'm left in peace to plot
my scheme for catching goats.

54
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm ready to catch those goats

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I'll put invisible walls on the path</i>

58
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was quick.

59
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I bought everything online.

60

Go after that car for me.
I left something in it.

62
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't see a car though.

63
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Use this to look for it.

64
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

65
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I called the driver
and got the car back.

66
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can't use a mobile phone.

67
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now take the trash out
to the furthest dumping ground.

68
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

69
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now I'll have some time to work.

70
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where's my toolbox?

71
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come back! That's not trash!

72
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Run inside this circle until I get back.

73
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't step out of the circle.

74
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, sir!

75
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I finally got rid of him.

76
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paddi, let's train.
You need to work out to be a man.

77
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's too tiring, and I'm not
bothered about being a man.

78
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolffy will catch you one day if you go on
like this.

79
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's it.

80
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going to force you to train
with me today.

81
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Watch out!

82
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't step out of the circle.

83
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was close. Why didn't you duck?

84
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My master told me to train in here.
He told me not to step out of the circle.

85
00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What kind of training is that?

86
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That must've been a test Master gave me.

87
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He wants me to do well in the marathon.

88
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's enough as long as we take part.
Why must we do well in it?

89
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm always the only one
who doesn't complete the marathon.

90
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I must work hard
this time to prove I can do it!

91
00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sure you'll be able to do it.

92
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go back and train.

93
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so tired. Can I take a nap first?

94
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come now.

95
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll get you all tomorrow.

96
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keep going!

97
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keep going! Hang in there...

98
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Him again?
He's distracting me from setting traps.

99
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

101
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really, Master?

102
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. This is your graduation gift from me.

103
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Master!

104
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wish you all the best tomorrow.

105
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, go get some rest.

106
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will do my best!

107
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now I'll lay my traps and wait for
the marathon to begin tomorrow.

108
