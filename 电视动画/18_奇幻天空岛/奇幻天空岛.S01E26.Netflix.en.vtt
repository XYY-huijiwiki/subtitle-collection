00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

11
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Such a big gem! It must be expensive!

12

Willie, where did you get that gem?

13
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

14
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There are plenty more very big gems.

15
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Jonie, I'm here to take over your shift.

22
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'll split up.
I'm sure we can find big gems.

23
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

24
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I won't let you off just like that!

25
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolnie is too anxious for this.
She didn't even plan ahead.

31
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

34
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

36
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

37

39
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait. You're not one of those fake Jonies?

40
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

41
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

So you are the real one?

42
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even though I couldn't find any gems,
I caught a goat.

43
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

44
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop hiding. You can't get away.

45
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

46
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

47
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

48
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By the way,
Jonie said she just saw a wolf.

49
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You better watch out.

50
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't worry, we have Magic Train.

51
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This room is so big.
When will I finish cleaning?

52
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paddi's the only one left here now.
I can catch him too.

53
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's still so much dust.
Should we use a vacuum cleaner?

54
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Luck is on my side. Even Tibbie is here.

55
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You guys are helping too? That's great!

56
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You want to run away?

57
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just give up, little goat.

58
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will test out my energy extractor.

59
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Again.

60
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where is it? Where did it go?

61
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How could I leave the
energy extractor with Wolnie?

62
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She always leaves things around
and loses them immediately.

63
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I don't have to hurry.

64
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll think of ways to eat the goat
once I get the mark.

65
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Should I steam or boil you?

Luckily,
I'm used to breaking my wife's perfume.

68

70
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So many?
Wolnie is spending without thinking again.

71
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Return them.

72
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll just tell Wolnie the goods
are out of stock.

73
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It saves money, and she won't be mad.

77

78
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. I must wait for Wolnie.

79
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By the way,
Jonie said she just saw a wolf.

80
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You better watch out.

81
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

82
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, Wolnie!

83
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolnie, I'm coming to save you.

84
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How come there's a bag on the floor?

85
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please give Wolnie back to me!

86
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hand Wolnie over now!
Or else I will eat Jonie.

87
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jonie?

88
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now you're scared, huh?

89
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you talking about me?

90
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

91
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, I caught her!

92
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How come you're here?
I locked you up in my house!

93
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've been here the whole time.

94
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait, you've been here the whole time?
Then where is Wolnie?

95
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I saw Wolnie,
but she disappeared immediately.

96
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no. Then who's that at home?

97
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did the power of my mark
turn Wolnie into me?

98
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Will you hurry up and untie me?

99
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolnie, it's all my fault!

100
00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

101
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolnie, you...

102
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You did so many things that made me angry,

103
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but when I saw how much you cared
about me, I couldn't stay angry.

104
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolnie!

105
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

106
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dad, Mom.

107
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

108

109
