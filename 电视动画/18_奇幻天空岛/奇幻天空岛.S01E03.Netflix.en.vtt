00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

94
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Before we start, I’ll get
a protective vest for you to wear.

95
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

96
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because it’s dangerous here

97
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The vest protects us while we work,

98
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

102
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

103
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

104
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

105
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

106
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you should wait
and work here for an entire year.

107
00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop thinking about it.

108
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

109
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

If I have to work here for a year,

111
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
how... how can I find my friends?

112
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It would be great if they’re working
in this factory too.

113
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But that’s just... impossible.

114
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can take a break
after I’m done with this box.

115
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did I just see Weslie?

116
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe I’m just hallucinating.

117
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, it’s time to get back to work.

118
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where could you guys be?

119
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, have you heard?

120
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Another land animal came to our factory.

121
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I heard. The new guy said
he was from some grassland.

122
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Excuse me, was it Green-Green Grassland?

123
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, that’s right.

124
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said he was from somewhere called
Green-Green Grassland.

125
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe they came for me!

126
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where is that person now?

127
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think he’s at the warehouse in area 11.

128
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you so much.

129
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the place.

130
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who is it?

131
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, Weslie, why don’t
you eat something first?

132
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much, Mister Jackie.

133
00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The birds were quite helpful.

134
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They told me there were
goats in this place.

135
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy... Wolffy is here!

136

-Excuse me!
-Stop!

138
00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No shouting and running in the factory.

139
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder how everyone is now.

140
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What if one of them is in danger?

141
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When can I find them?

142
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, is that you, Paddi?

143
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ha! Weslie!

144
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That was really you
who I saw this morning.

145
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It really is you.

146
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How come you’re here too?

147
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ve been waiting forever for you guys.

148
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought you already gave
up looking for me.

149
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, don’t be silly.
Let’s go together and look for--

150
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The other goats?

151
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I almost forgot about Wolffy.

152
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take my hand!

153
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew you’d have a mark too.

154
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you going to do?

155
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Extract the energy from the gem
on your hand, of course.

156
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy!

157
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you really think...

158
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you can beat a supervillain like me?

159
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

161
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There’s nowhere for you to run.

162

164
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait and see, goats.
