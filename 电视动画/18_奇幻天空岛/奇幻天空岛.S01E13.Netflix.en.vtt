12
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

14
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

15
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are balloons,

16
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

17
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

18
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't worry.

19
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

20
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

21
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

22
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

29
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Are you hurt?

32

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

38
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

39
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

40
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Also, you destroyed our houses.

41
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

43
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

44
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

45
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I, Wolffy, won't--

46
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Won't what?

47
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

49
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We just need to put our palm mark
on the new Magic Train

50
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

51
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That amazing?

52
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's give it a try then.

53
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this my seat?

54
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on, try activating it
with your palm mark.

55
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's see what the function is.

56
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Start!

57
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good afternoon, goats.

58
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
General Balloon!

59
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I saw you come aboard Magic Train,
so I came to take a look.

60
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You didn't do anything dangerous, right?

61
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course not.

62
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's good then. I'm leaving.

63
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Be careful, okay?

64
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
General Balloon blocked our view just now.

65
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can't tell what the beam
from Magic Train does.

66
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And this button isn't lit up anymore.

67
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That means the skill is cooling off.

68
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's try again later.

69
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're done!

70
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Son, there's still a lot
more rubbish to clear.

71
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why's there so much rubbish here?

72
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The storm is to blame.

73
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like all this stuff, we came from Earth.

74
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>we gathered together</i>

77
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>For safety purposes, we built high walls.</i>

78
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But there're still many things</i>

79
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>So, our duty is to clear the rubbish</i>

81
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't stand this weight either.

82
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

83
00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolnie!

84
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has cooled off.

85
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's try aiming it at the apple.

86
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good idea.

87
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I found a fridge full of food.

88
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Start!

89
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, everybody.
I found a fridge full of food!

90
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi! Move out of the way!

91
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a big harvest!

92
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing happened to me?

93
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why has the fridge shrunk?

94
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has also become very light.

95
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It doesn't hurt at all.

96
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What exactly is going on?

97
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It turns out that Sparky's skill is to
make something strong and tough.

98
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see!

99
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm back to normal.

100
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it only lasts for ten minutes.

101
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's impossible to clear all the rubbish!

102
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I must find Sirius soon
and take Wolnie and Willie away.

103
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where are you going?

104
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going to sweep every corner
of this city.

105
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must try and find out where Sirius is.

106
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Balloon City is so small.
Where do you hide big objects?

107
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why should I tell you?

108
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's because you don't know, right?

109
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course I know!

110
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the giant goods warehouse.
Big enough, huh?

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't mean this.

112
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want to go to the place
where vehicles are kept.

113
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

114
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Garage, boatyard, hangar.

115
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There are so many planes.

116
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can take Wolnie away from here.

117
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But these are only models.

118
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I guess I must be explicit.</i>

119
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, I want to know where Sirius is.

120
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Turn left at the intersection
ahead and you'll see it.

121
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow! There's a flying saucer!

122
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That isn't a flying saucer!

123
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's clearly a huge rock!

124
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Emergency! A huge meteorite
will hit Balloon City within ten minutes.

125
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please take necessary precautions
to avoid the impact.

126
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What should we do?

127
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Calm down, everybody!

128
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't we have the beam
that makes one strong and tough?

129
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can just use it to turn one of us
into a giant and knock the meteorite away.

130
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I must do it. I have the experience.

131
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Si... rius?

132
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This isn't Sirius!

133
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So Magic Train is parked here.

134
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't that...

135
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just let me save everybody.

136
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A goat?

137
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let me catch a few goats
before locating Sirius.

138
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no. Wolffy got hit by the strong beam.

139
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's strong and tough now.

140
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's gonna eat us all.

141
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've become strong and tough.

142
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now I'm powerful.

143
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nothing can stop me from
catching the goats now.

144
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy!

145
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolffy, you've been smirking
for the past nine and a half minutes.

146
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your ability
will be gone in thirty seconds.

147
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thirty seconds is enough time
for me to catch you all.

148
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolffy? Is this the time to think
about catching goats?

149
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look up!

150
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

151
00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolffy, while you're still strong
and tough, knock the rock away.

152
