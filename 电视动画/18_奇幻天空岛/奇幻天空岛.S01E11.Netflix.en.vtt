Paddi, you are abusing Magic Train again.

13
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, I won't do it again.

we're doing the cleaning together?

19
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will use my doppelgangers

20
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

22
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How about I buy you this car?

23
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You just bought me one yesterday.

24
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How about this one?

25
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You bought me that
the day before yesterday too.

26
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's look at other toys.

27
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What other toys
has Willie not played with before?

28
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I can't think of anything.

29
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I should leave
before Wolffy finds out I'm here.

30
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. I have to find a place to hide first.

31
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is strange.
Where did that little spaceship go?

32
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dad, I want this spaceship.

33
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shop owner, I'll take this.

34
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure.

35
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Great!
Let's go home and play with the spaceship.

36
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How did this happen?

37
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can finally work on my invention.

38
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Spaceship, go...

39
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I knew this would happen,
I'd have cleaned with Weslie.

40
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. I must escape before Wolffy finds out.

41
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great. The gate is open.

42
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow! The spaceship
is moving on its own again.

43
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is strange.
Did I get the recipe wrong?

44
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so close to escaping.

45
00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Spaceship, why are you going around?
Let's play together.

46
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How can I let Willie know I am here
without letting Wolffy know?

47
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is...

48
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It worked. Willie recognized me.

49
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dad. Look. This spaceship
can stack blocks on its own.

50
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh no! I can't let Wolffy find out.

51
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dad, look.

52
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is strange.

53
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Willie, I'm really busy now.
Go play on your own.

54
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Phew!

55
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This way, Willie will surely understand.

56
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Willie, look this way.

57
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did Willie draw?

58
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great! Wolffy left.

59
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now I can tell Willie my identity openly.

60
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Willie, look this way.

61
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Willie.

62
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I give up.

63
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Willie, come with me. We're going out.

64
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

65
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's go.
-Okay.

66
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good timing.

67
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What was that sound?

68
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy almost found me again.

69
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What should I do now? Right!

70
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't think they could help out
with cleaning too.

71
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi!

72
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How come my doppelgangers
are not here yet?

73
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is strange. Where did the screw go?

74
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh no! Wolffy is coming.

75
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I still need a hammer and an apple.

76
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm safe finally.

77
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, Paddi.

78
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The goat I have wanted
to catch is right by me after all.

79
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are not getting away this time.

80
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're here at last.

81
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Since you are here, let me give you
a taste of my vacuum cleaner

82
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that is specially designed to

83
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
deal with Magic Train's doppelgangers.

84
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

85
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Magic Train, combine!

86
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This was the worst
combining mode I've seen.

87
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's going on?

88
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How come I'm one cart short?

89
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not going anywhere.

90
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where did the last piece go?

91
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened?

92
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your invention is not that good either.

93
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How dare you laugh at my invention?
I will show you!

94
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is Wolffy crazy?

95
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whatever. I'll just run.

96
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I made it.

97
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is my upgraded vacuum cleaner.
You're not going anywhere!

98
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dad!

99
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mom and I picked up
a spaceship on the street

100
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that looks exactly like the one
we got at the toy store.

101
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Willie is in there! Magic Train, Combine!

102
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even if you are combined,
my vacuum cleaner can suck you in.

103
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Magic Train, full power.

104
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi, I'll get you!

105
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paddi, remember.
Don't ever abuse Magic Train again.

106
00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I won't.

107
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, Weslie,
I found something interesting.

108
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look.

109
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolffy's vacuum cleaner is quite fun.
