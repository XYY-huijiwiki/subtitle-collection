70
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

71
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

72
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

73
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

74
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

75
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

81

86
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

87
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

110
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Just like you, we miss the baby so much.

114
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

116
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

117
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

122
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

123
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

124
00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

131
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

134
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

135
00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

136
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

137
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

141
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

142
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
