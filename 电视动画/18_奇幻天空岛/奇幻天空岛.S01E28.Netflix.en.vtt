00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're still missing one fragment.

13
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Based on my experience,
when you lose something,

16
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you never find it when you look for it.

17
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you stop looking for it,
it'll appear on its own.

18
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So quit thinking about it.

19
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go back to your normal routine.

20
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That can't be true, Paddi.
Get up and help us look for it.

21
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, this is just a marble.

24
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

26

27
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

28
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry, Willie.
We're too busy to play as well.

30
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

31
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Can I borrow your remote control car then?

32
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course. Go get it from our Magic Train.

33
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

43

45
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

for the remote control car?

46
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

50
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know!

51
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where could
the last sky crystal fragment be?

52
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come to think of it, Wolffy
was there the day sky crystal shattered.

53
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, he must have the last fragment!

54
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's slander!
Pure slander! Blatant slander!

55
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy? What do you want?

56
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You keep making false accusations
about me!

57
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You said I stole the colored pencil
when you lost it.

58
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then you blamed me
for stealing the star diamond.

59
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a simple wolf.

60
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All I want is to eat goats.

61
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why do you keep falsely accusing me?

62
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We searched him. There are no fragments.

63
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He doesn't have a mark on his hand either.

64
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Seems like Wolffy
really doesn't have the sky crystal.

65
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh, do you believe I'm innocent now?

66
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, Wolffy, why are you here?

67
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a long story.

68
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The thing is,

69
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the precious gemstone I bought Wolnie,
the desert tear, has gone missing.

70
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It might be mixed with Willie's marbles.

71
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm wondering if it could be with you.

72
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could Willie have left it on Magic Train
when he was playing there?

73
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can I go look for the gem
inside Magic Train?

74
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why don't we let Wolffy in for a look?

75
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No! He must be plotting something.

76
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's fine. The other sky crystal fragments
are with Cloud Giant.

77
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Magic Train isn't functioning right now.

78
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go on then, since Village Chief agreed.

79
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

80
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hold on!

81
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't eat my biscuits!

82
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course...

83
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everyone,

84
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cloud Giant wants to ask you
how you found sky crystal.

85
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cloud Giant wants to see us?

86
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He may have come up with clues
on sky crystal. Let's go then.

87
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm worried about Wolffy's intentions.

88
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why don't you keep an eye on Wolffy,
Paddi?

89
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, since you're so worried
that he would eat your biscuits.

90
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why me?

91
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fine. We'll be back soon.

92
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm starving.

93
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Older brother,
the chips we got at the mall were so good.

94
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Remember to buy more next time.

95
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

96
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Snacks? I know what to do!

97
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I guessed right,
it must be inside Magic Train.

98
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Wolffy! I'm watching you!</i>
<i>Don't try anything funny!</i>

100
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Since when did Paddi get so serious?

101
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This isn't like him.

102

104
00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am sorry
if you feel like I'm showing off.

105
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all my Wolffy's fault. He insisted
on buying me this huge, expensive gem.

106
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He said it's called desert tear.

107
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Desert tear?
Didn't Wolffy say it was lost? Was he...

108
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have some clues.

109
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could you tell me
how you found your missing friends?

110
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The radar on Magic Train can detect them.

111
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Based on what I know, only sky crystals
can resonate with and detect each other.

112
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh?

113
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No wonder the radar started detecting
the locations of my other friends

114
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
after using sky crystal for the first time
in Tower Town.

115
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the last sky crystal fragment
may very well be in Magic Train.

116
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no!

117
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paddi, weren't you supposed
to be watching Wolffy?

118
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I saw with my own eyes
that the gem is still with Wolnie!

119
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

120
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So Wolffy went on Magic Train
to find the missing sky crystal fragment.

121
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where is it? Why can't I find it?

122
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy, you really are up to no good!

123
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How did they find out so quickly?

124
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolffy, we have you surrounded.
Hand over the energy extractor now.

125
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come get it, if you dare!

126
00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A camera?

127
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How despicable of you, Wolffy!

128
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How could you tap Magic Train
to spy on us?

129
00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Will you stop making false accusations
about me?

130
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As a high-end inventor,
if I were to spy on you,

131
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
would I use such cheap
and outdated equipment?

132
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I were to spy on you,
I would be using this!

133
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh! Isn't that Willie's cap?

134
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't believe you used Willie
to spy on us.

135
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're terrible!

136
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But if this isn't Wolffy's,

137
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
who is spying on us then?

138
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't think of running, Wolffy!

139
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sky crystal...

140
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm right, after all.
Sky crystal is on Magic Train!

141
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolffy, you won't get away this time!
Hand over sky crystal now!

142
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Since I decided to come, I came prepared.

143
00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Be careful, everyone!

144
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Goodbye, goats!

145
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop escaping!

146
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hand over sky crystal now!

147
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Escape?
You are always the ones escaping from me!

148
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dance, Wolffy!

149
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I forgot
we don't have sky crystals anymore!

150
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Magic Train is garbage
without sky crystal!

151
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get a taste of my Sirius missile!

152
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll see how long you can dodge this!

153
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't hurt the goats, Wolffy!

154
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're also here, Cloud Giant?

155
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy, you can't escape this time!

156
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll admit defeat, all right?

157
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can have sky crystal. Go look for it!

158
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy, you--

159
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have sky crystal!

160
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a marble! Wolffy fooled us!

161
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sky crystal is mine now!

162
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no. We are too late.

163
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perfect timing.

164
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let me show you
the true power of sky crystal!

165
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
