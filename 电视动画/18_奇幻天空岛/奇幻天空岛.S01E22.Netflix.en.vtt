It's so noisy out there.
I want to open my eyes and look.

111
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, if you do, the shot will be ruined.

112
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm starving.

113
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are they doing?
What a strange practice.

114
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll take a photo of it.

115
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I heard that Flat-beak Allen was here.

116
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's right. I've told my friends
to look out for him.

117
00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look out for my flashy fist.

118
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Slow down!

119
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cannon attack!

120
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Split up!

121
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You guys are ganging up against me.

122
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll ask my gang to back me up.
The seven evil--

123
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dancing mode again?

124
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop dancing.

125
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop...

126
00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Elder Star, I just heard "stop".

127
00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can open our eyes then.

128
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I won't let you go like that! Seven--

129
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Wolffy, what should we shoot next?</i>

130
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop. Oh, no!

131
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is the promotional video done?

132
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so sorry. I lost the tape.

133
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's such a pity.

134
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This performance was fantastic.

135
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We got 300 more likes.

136
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is strange.
How come it was so crowded today?

137
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know why. Look.

138
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it's Flat-beak Allen's touring diary.

139
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When did Flat-beak Allen get here?

140
00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yesterday.

141
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But he said he was on a secret trip
and told me to keep quiet about it.

142
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flat-beak Allen came here yesterday!

143
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I missed the chance
to take a photo with him.

144
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, you didn't. Look.

145
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What else did Flat-beak Allen tell you?

146
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nothing much. I thought he was a bad guy
so I jumped him.

147
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

148
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He is fine. I helped him get up.

149
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? You got to help him up?

150
00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the hand
that touched Flat-beak Allen.

151
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't ever wash your hand.

152
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Was it because of Flat-beak Allen
that we got so many likes?

153
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
More tourists came
because of Flat-beak Allen.

154
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it wasn't the reason
we got more likes.

155
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The real reason was them.
