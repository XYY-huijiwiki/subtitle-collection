10
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think a storm is coming.
Should we find a place to take shelter?

11
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

12
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

30
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can't let this continue.
We have to break through it.

31
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

37
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

38
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

39
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

40
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

41
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

43
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

46

47
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

48
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing...

49
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

50
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn’t expect the citizens
to be balloons too.

51
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh no, this is terrible.
Guys, come check this out.

52
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What is it?
-Look.

53
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sparky?
-Sparky?

54
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This isn’t the only wanted notice.
It's posted everywhere.

55
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is Sparky wanted?

56
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie, what should we do now?

57
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s go back first.

58
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It'll be easier to find him
using the Magic Train.

59
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sir, we suspect that Sparky is hiding
inside this unidentified flying object.

60
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s go in and search immediately then.

61
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're trying to arrest Sparky?

62
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why do they look so familiar?

63
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
White hair, horns on their heads.

64
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got it. They are Sparky’s fellow mates.

65
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hurry, take them back now.

66
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh no, run!

67
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop!

68
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop!

69
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolnie, son, where are you two?

70
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop!

71
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a dead end. What should we do?

72
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a gap between the balloon walls.
Let’s hide inside.

73
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh no, I’m stuck.

74
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How come they've disappeared?
Let’s split up and find them.

75
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, sir.

76
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The soldiers left.

77
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie? How come you guys are here?

78
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sparky!

79
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

80
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sparky!

81
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sparky!
-Are you guys all right?

82
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a storm outside.
How did you get in?

83
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Calm down, Sparky.
The new Magic Train brought us here.

84
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The new Magic Train?

85
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, the new Magic Train
was constructed by a mechanical expert

86
00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
whom I met in Tower Town.

87
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is wonderful.
With a new Magic Train...

88
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He isn’t listening to me at all.

89
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I hear Sparky's voice from there.
Let’s go check it out.

90
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let’s leave quickly. Otherwise,
they'll take me back to General Balloon.

91
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wait for me!
-Where're we going?

92
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To look for the Magic Train of course.

93
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They would surely send
a big flying object like the Magic Train

94
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to the dangerous goods warehouse.

95
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have to stop them before it gets there.

96
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Sparky,
why do they want to arrest you?

97
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a long story.

100
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is this place?

101
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, he has horns.

102
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait.

103
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t move.

105

106

108
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, that is so scary!
He poked the tree.

109
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No wonder they also want to arrest us.
It's because of these horns.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All clear. Let’s go.

111
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sparky.

112
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? Run!

113
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop running.

114
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're chasing us.
What should we do?

115
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s hide inside the rubbish bin. What?

116
00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? Where did they go?

117
00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s check over there.

118
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you here?

119
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How dare you ask me that?

120
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh no, why are we sucked into it as well?

121
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If not for you guys,

122
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
my family and I wouldn’t have
ended up in this strange place.

123
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

124
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>a group of balloon soldiers appeared.</i>

125

129
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

130
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wonder how Wolnie and Willie
are doing now.

131
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

132
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I suppose Sirius has also been taken

133
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to the dangerous goods warehouse
by those balloons.

134
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dangerous goods warehouse?
How dangerous can that be?

135
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy, calm down.

136
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let’s get the Magic Train
and Sirius back together.

137
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are we waiting for then? We...

138
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stop!
-Run!

139
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s Sparky and that grey fellow.

140
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Capture them now.

141
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Intercept Sparky and that grey fellow!

142
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look. Magic Train is right there.

143
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where is Sirius then?

144
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have no idea either.

145
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

146
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll take another route.
Nothing goes well when I'm with you.

147
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've finally caught you.

148
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolffy disappeared
right after we turned around.

149
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope he didn't get caught.

150
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Move it. Split into two teams
and surround them from both sides.

151
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They can't escape then.
-Yes, sir.

152
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What is going on? Why has Wolffy
suddenly become the balloons' leader?

153
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Friends, I'm really trying
to help you capture the goats.

154
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you untie me first?

155
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way. You are wanted by us.

156
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They won't be able to escape.

157
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh no!

158
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll divert them.

159
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get on the Magic Train.

160
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, come catch me.

161
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's get on the Magic Train now.

162
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop!

163
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop!

164
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can't get away.

165
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't run!

166
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sparky, come aboard now.

167
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't let them get away.
Toss me over there now.

168
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

169
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why didn't you untie me before tossing me?

170
00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can finally leave this place.

171
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go!

172
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh no!

173
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The storm is too powerful.
We can't break through at all.

174
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
General Balloon, they're back.

175
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
General Balloon.

176
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sparky... are you injured?

177
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I told you, you wouldn't be able
to break through. You never listen to me.

178
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You forced me to post posters
everywhere to bring you home.

179
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-What?

180
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This isn't a wanted notice
but a missing person notice?

181
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. Sparky is my good friend.
Why would I want him arrested?

182
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He didn't cause a commotion
when he first got here?

183
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He did cause a commotion
when he first came to Balloon City.

184
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really won't harm you.

185
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't move.

186
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Help! There's a child deflating.

187
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Help!

188
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mom.
-My child.

189
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
General Balloon, you're here.

190
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you the one? What is your name?

191
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sparky.

192
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey. Way to go!

193
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sparky, I saw your heroic act just now.

194
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
From now on, you are
a good friend of Balloon City.

196
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't expect your friends
to misunderstand.

197
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come. Since your friends are here,

198
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
let's go back and celebrate with a feast.

199
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, there's delicious food. Let's go!

200
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You ended up getting caught too.

201
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you friends with them?

202
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, no, no... I don't know them at all.

203
00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, that's great. Take him to prison.

204
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm a good guy.
Why am I going to prison? Wait...
