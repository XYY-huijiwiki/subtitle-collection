12
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

46
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

54
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

55
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

56
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

67
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

68
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

69
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. We can't afford to lose Willie

76
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

93
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

94
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then let's get out of here immediately.

95
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Can't you see such a handsome wolf here?

97
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

98
00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Wolnie and Willie came too.
Let's get out of here quickly.

100

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy, you're running too fast.

102
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

103
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, right, there's a little fish too.

104
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

105
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Weslie and I heard a voice,
so we went into the cave.

106
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

107
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I went to save him because I'm kind
and ended up trapped with Weslie.

108
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I went into the cave to hide
from the falling rocks,

109
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then a dark shadow passed behind me,

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I was caught in a trap.

111
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A dark shadow?

112
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm finally done fixing Magic Train.

113
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mommy, I see Dad.

114
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This must be the data recorder
of Magic Train.

115
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hold on.

116
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did he cause the rocks to fall?

117
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Village Chief.

118
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Children, glad to know you're all right.

119
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie, you have to be careful!

120
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That fish might be a villain.

121
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie...

122
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie! Little fish, what are you doing?

123
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Little fish?

124
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who told you I'm a fish?

125
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, no, I'm stuck...
Give me a little time.

126
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is...

127
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A black cloud person?

128
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've been lying low among you
for a long time.

129
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>The video camera on Magic Train,</i>

130
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>the note picked up by Mechanical Bird,</i>
<i>I did all that.</i>

131
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>In order to get the sky crystal,</i>

132
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I even lured you to go underwater.</i>

133
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But I didn't expect you to escape</i>

134
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I see. You pretended to be trapped
and lured us into the cave.

135
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. Actually,
I wanted to lure you into the cave.

136
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you came close to me,
I would press the red button and trap you.

137
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But there's dirt
on such a perfect remote control!

138
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't let that happen.

139
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I pressed the wrong button!

140
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I modified my plan
and continued to lure you.

141
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm here!

142
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Someone's trapped. We'll save you.

143
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I intended to trap you after you saved me.</i>

144
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>However, I left a thread</i>
<i>on the remote control when I wiped it.</i>

145
00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're trapped too.

146
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is how we all ended up being trapped.

147
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn't matter anymore
because I've got the sky crystal!

148
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What do you need the sky crystal for?
-I'm going to destroy it.

149
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is my gem.
I won't let you destroy it.

150
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give it back to me.

151
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's help Wolffy.

152
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I caught him.

153
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

154
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can't escape. Give in now.

155
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I won't give in easily.

156
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Goodbye, everyone!

157
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't go!

158
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Children...

159
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you all right?

160
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Village Chief, the sky crystal was taken.
Let's hurry and get it back.

161
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolnie, Willie, this place
is too dangerous. Let's get out of here.

162
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolffy, aren't you going
to help us chase the villain?

163
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't get myself involved
in dangerous things like that.

164
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm taking my wife and son
away from this dangerous place.

165
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In that case,
we'll chase the villain ourselves.

166
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.
