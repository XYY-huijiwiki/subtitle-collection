00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not that. There's another matter
I need your help with.

28
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want me to use my growth powers

29
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's just a baby.

30
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why can't you let him grow up naturally?

31
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

32
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He ate an infantilizing fruit
in the restricted area by accident.

33
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's why he turned into a baby.

34
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Infantilizing fruit?

35
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

36
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me restore him to his original form.

37
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Turn off the music!

38
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just wanted to play music
that goes with the situation.

39
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you to turn it off, didn't I?

40
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

41
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

42
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm starving.
Because I've been travelling,

43
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've used up all my energy.
I need to eat something to recuperate.

44
00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

45
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all right.
Let us get you a meal first!

46
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great!

47
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When he gets his body back,
he'll leave, right?

48
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't just let him leave.

51
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Before you leave,
we have to give you kisses first.

52
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew it.

53
00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Found it!

54
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Infantilizing fruits.

55
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can get over this flimsy fence
in no time.

56
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got so many infantilizing fruits.

57
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure I can capture
all the goats this time.

59
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The baby is going to grow up soon.
Hopefully, he'll like my present.

60
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Elder, what present did you get for him?

61
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Medium-sized diapers. It's one size
larger than what he wore before.

62
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm full.
Now I can start restoring the baby.

63
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

64
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can finally be my old self again.

65
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I could go back
to when I was 18 years old...

66
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

67
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is not what I want to look like!

68
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is not what we want him
to look like either!

69
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why did you
turn our lovely baby into this?

70
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Exactly. You must've overused your power.

71
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just restored him according
to the photo they gave me.

72
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Great! Village Chief

73
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is what he looks like?

74
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't believe it. The baby was so cute.
He isn't this old man.

75
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

76
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

77

78
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't insult me.
I have lawyers at my service.

79
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How dare you try to run away

80
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I might look a bit old,
but I still have a cute side.

81
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The stars are just shocked.
Let us comfort them.

82
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Time Star disappeared.

83
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How could he?

84
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How could he turn
our cute baby into an old man?

85
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's nothing to cry about.

86
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll get used to the way he looks
after a while.

87
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My heart tells me I won't get used to it.

88
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we hate the way the baby looks
after growing up, he'll be really upset.

89
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I seem to be feeling his tears.

90
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm getting this fruity flavor.

91
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

92
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Old stars, you were sprayed

93
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a mist made

94
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is not only convenient, healthy,

95
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go now! It's very dangerous here.

111
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You still have your powers?
Right, they only shrank in size.

112
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Their superpowers should still be working.

113
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Oh no! It's the stars.

118
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Be good, little lambs. Don't run around.

Wear the night-vision goggles.

Who stepped on me? Stop pulling my hair!

What's all that noise? I can't sleep!

126
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolnie, quick! Help me catch the goats.

129
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You old goat, you still have time
to look into a mirror?

130
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, my hair!

131
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

132
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A monster!

133
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good little stars. It's time for bed.

134
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paddi, you drank too much.

135
00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sparky, it's dangerous to climb so high.

136
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't cry...
I will change your diaper right away.

137
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're safe now, but do I have to
take care of them till they grow up?

138
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because you wrongly accused me,

142
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I plan to take legal action.

143

Where are all the old stars?

145
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They were turned into babies.
Please help restore them.

146
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

If you apologize,
I won't take legal action...

149
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's right. We were saved
because of your superpowers.

150
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was successful because the baby--
I mean, Slowy's plan was perfect.

151
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No... Everyone was very helpful
in playing their part.

152
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did anyone hear me?

153
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

154
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if it weren't for you,
we wouldn't have recovered.

155
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

156
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

157
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't mention it.

158
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We misunderstood you.

159
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I'll forgive you this time.

161
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You haven't gotten over
what the Chief looks like now. Am I right?

162
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course not.

163
00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why did you sigh then?

164
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was just wondering

165
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if I could return
the medium-sized diapers.
