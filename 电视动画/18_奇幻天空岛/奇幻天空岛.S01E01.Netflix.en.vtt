Yes, I've travelled to

43
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

44
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, I'll wait for you.

47
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

48
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm starving. Wilie is such a caring boy.

49
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

50
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No! I prepared this birthday cake

51
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

52
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

53
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

55
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If Wolnie finds out
I forgot to get her a present...

56
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How could you?

57
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

58
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, I can give her a bunch of flowers.

59
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

62
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

64
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

65
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

66
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Set off.

67
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

68
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of... Of course not. There's more!

69
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just close your eyes and wait for it.

70

This gem is for me? It's quite pretty.

72
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hold on, why does it look so familiar?

73

74
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

75
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

how about we have a goat feast tonight?

78
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure.

79
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

80
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

81
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks like there's a bird following us.

82
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

83
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

84
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

85
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

87
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you don't stand a chance.

88

89
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

92
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

94
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Weslie is in danger!

98

100
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

101
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

102
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

105
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

107
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
