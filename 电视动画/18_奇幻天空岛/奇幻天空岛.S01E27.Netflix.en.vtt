58
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

59
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

66
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Spill it. What do you have to do

67
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

68
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sky crystal fell from the sky.

69
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What? Shouldn't you say
the sky crystal was stolen by a bird?

70
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Think carefully. Don't blame the innocent.

71
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

72
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

73
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was going after the thief
who stole the sky crystal.

74
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't run! Give it back to me!

75
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Close your eyes.

76
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give the sky crystal back.

77
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I won't give it back to you!

78
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because of that super thunderstorm,
the thief got away.

79
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the thief
should still have the sky crystal.

80
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's only one explanation then.

81
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

82
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

83
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

84

85
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

86
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just as I picked up the gem,

111
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this giant fell out
of the sky and smashed the plane.

112
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cloud Giant! So it was you
who broke the plane!

113
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so sorry.

114
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was really chaotic,

115
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I tripped and fell by accident.

116
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened afterwards, Wolffy?

117
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cloud Giant's fall resulted
in a huge shock wave.

118
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm doomed!

119
00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The parachute!

120
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why won't it open now?

121
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Luckily, I opened the parachute in time.

122
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened after that, Wolffy?

123
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then we happened to land at the gate of
Goats Village.

124
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>A group of armed goats rushed towards me</i>

125
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>and rescued Slowy.</i>

126
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I escaped back to Wolf Fortress</i>
<i>with the gem,</i>

127
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>only to realize it'd turned into</i>
<i>a common purple color.</i>

128
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Years later, during a home renovation,</i>

129
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I embedded the gem into a photo frame.</i>

130
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you really found the sky crystal
by accident.

131
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course. I told you I was innocent.

132
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Innocent? Then why are you carrying
the weather fruit around?

133
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You must be planning to catch us with it.

134
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't be silly. How can I catch goats
with just one weather fruit?

135
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy, you dropped many more.

136
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have many weather fruits on you!

137
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you said
you're not planning on catching us?

138
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Oh, no. I should get out of here.</i>

139
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bye.

140
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He ran off.

141
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cloud Giant, since you are back

142
00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and we have the fragments
of the sky crystal,

143
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
let's put it back together.

144
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure.

145
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go back!

146
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why did that thief
throw away the sky crystal?

147
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
