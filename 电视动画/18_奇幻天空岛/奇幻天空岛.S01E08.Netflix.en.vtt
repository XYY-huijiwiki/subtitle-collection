So many people!
I wonder if Tibbie'll be here.

10
00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie, I'm so nervous!

11
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't look nervous at all.

12
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Hello, competitors. I am your host today.

14
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Welcome to the venue
for the rainbow puzzle contest.

15
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let me explain the rules
for this competition.

16
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
First, find the nine
puzzle pieces hidden in the city,

17
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then piece them together correctly.

18
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One of the puzzle pieces is one of a kind.

19
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
First one to finish the puzzle
will win our mystery prize.

20
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I must win this time
to get the prize for Wolnie.

21
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lastly, I would like to remind everyone

22
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that some boxes
do not have puzzle pieces inside.

23
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you are unlucky,
there will be small penalties.

24
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everyone must be careful.

25
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The contest has now officially begun.

26
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Such a big city.
Where should we go to find puzzle pieces?

27
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Be patient, Paddi.

28
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Searching like this is way too hard.
Look at my skills.

29
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I found a box.

30
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quick, open it.

31
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a fake one.

32
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weslie, I'm tired. We should take a break.

33
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's another box.

34
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll bring it down. Let's see.

35
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could it be another fake?

36
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll know when we open it.

37
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's that one-of-a-kind puzzle piece.

38
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Who knew we could find pieces
while trying to sleep?

39
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paddi, let's split up
to find the other pieces.

40
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll finish the mission faster that way.

41
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

42
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I knew Green Bean
would hide the pieces here.

43
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Red Bean, aren't you a referee?

44
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why would you be looking for pieces?

45
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh-oh! Um, you see...

46
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why can't I find any pieces anywhere?

47
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait, you there. You were too careless.

48
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You dropped this just now.

49
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I dropped this?

50
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Puzzle pieces? But these pieces...

51
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hid them so well.
There's no way they will find them.

52
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't it because I picked the best places?

53
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought of them first.

54
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was me.

55
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It was me.
-It was me.

56
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No more fighting. Let's go find
the captain and she can tell us.

57
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good idea.

58
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you copying me?

59
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You copied me!

60
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You guys copied me!

61
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You copied me!

62
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can we really find puzzle pieces

63
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in such a faraway place?

64
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course. With less competition,
it's more likely we'll find something.

65
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, that makes sense!
I guess that means we'll win!

66
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After we get the prize,
we'll catch the goats too.

67
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dad, what is that?

68
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a puzzle piece box.

69
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quick, open it!

70
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Argh, it's fake!

71
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolffy,
this isn't what you said it would be!

72
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolnie, calm down!

73
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mom, look!

74
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a door here!

75
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks a little strange.

76
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe there are lots
of puzzle pieces inside.

77
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolnie, look at this vase.

78
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's so artsy. It suits my taste so well!

79
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's also a couch.

80
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It gives such a familiar feeling.

81
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolnie, look at the kid in this photo.

82
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He looks so much like Willie.
They're basically identical.

83
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy, look around carefully.

84
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't this our room on Sirius?

85
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't expect the main body of Sirius
to end up in Rainbow City.

86
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolnie, wait here at the house.

87
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll go win the prize for you.

88
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Puzzle pieces...

89
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is it so hard to open?

90
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Another box!

91
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Awesome, it's a puzzle piece.

92
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ugh, searching like this is such a pain.
Sirius!

93
00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give me all your puzzle pieces.

94
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Run!
Someone is snatching the puzzle pieces!

95
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll surely win this time!

96
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How could Wolffy do this?

97
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just missing one piece
to finish the puzzle.

98
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This guy has stolen so many pieces.
I should follow him.

99
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cheater is over there.

100
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no one there.

101
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was just here.

102
00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should hurry and find the pieces.

103
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It'd be too dangerous
if it continued like this.

104
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have no choice but to stop Wolffy.

105
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hurry up and hand over your pieces.

106
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wolffy! Do you want
the one-of-a-kind piece? I have it here.

107
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Weslie, are you here
to hand me the gold medal?

108
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That looks like Paddi.

109
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

116
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

117
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

124
00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You guys wait and see!

125
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

128

Wolffy, even if you catch us,
there's no way you'll get the pieces.

137

138
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

151
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
