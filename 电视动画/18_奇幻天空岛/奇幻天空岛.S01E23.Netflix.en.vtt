My wooden horse!

114
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I'll make him catch the goats.</i>

115
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, right...
Can you give this to Weslie for me?

116
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

117
00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because it's his birthday today.

118
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see. Let me do it.

119
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait! Where're you going?

120
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Didn't you tell me
to deliver the present for you?

121
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Since you can make wishes come true,

122
00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
can't you deliver it to him right away?

123
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, sure... What's that?

124
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

125
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's nothing there.

126
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where is the present?

127
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've already delivered it to him for you.

128
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well done.
Let me see if they like the gift.

129
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no! I have to deliver it now.

130
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good, I got here before Wolffy.

131
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Grandpa Star?

132
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, Weslie, it's great you're here.
Happy birthday.

133
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you for your present.

134
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Open it now.

135
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't drop it.
-Thank you.

136
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But how did you know
it's my birthday today?

137
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't.

138
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is from Wolffy.
-Wolffy?

139
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've delivered the present. Goodbye.

140
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bomb!

141
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It should be about time.

142
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why does this soda can look so familiar?

143
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is it me again?

144
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wolffy, I made your wish come true.

145
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know. Thank you.

146
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you hurt?

147
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't ask. I need some medicine now.

148
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

149
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No... It's nothing. Let me try again.

150
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hurry and make my wish come true.

151
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wish...

152
00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What now?

153
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow! It worked. My power is back.

154
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to go and help more people.

155
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. I should've just wished to recover.

156
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey! Come back!

157
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hair Growth Star, do you have a wish?

158
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course! I want to be handsome.

159
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No problem!

160
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wish… come true!

161
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is strange.

162
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Go try over there.
Don't bother me when I'm having dinner.

163
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you have a wish?

164
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I would like to grow tall.
-Wish… come true!

165
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew I have the power in me.

166
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just stood up. My wish didn't come true.

167
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is my power so unsteady?

168
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's going on?

169
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I finally found out that
my power is to make wishes come true.

170
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But my power is unsteady.

171
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you sure your power
is making wishes come true?

172
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is. If you don't believe me,
ask Wolffy.

173
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I found you!

174
00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have one more wish. I would like to...

175
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you all right?
You're here just in time.

176
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you all right?
-Why did you shock me?

177
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shock... That's impossible.

178
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can release electricity too?

179
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have the power to make wishes come true
and release electricity.

180
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're thinking too much.
Every star only has one power.

181
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I made wishes come true
for people earlier.

182
00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I helped repair Willie's toy car.</i>

183
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I fixed Paddi's television.</i>

184
00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I also fixed Wolffy's invention.</i>

185
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must be a Wishing Star.

186
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How about the rest?
Did all the wishes come true?

187
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I couldn't fix Willie's wooden horse.

188
00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I also couldn't deliver the present
for Wolffy.

189
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I couldn't make others grow handsome
or taller.

190
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were conducting electricity
and repaired the appliance by chance.

191
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Therefore, you are Electric Star.

192
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I can't make wishes come true.

193
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My power seems quite useless.

194
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not true. It's a very useful power.

195
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Awesome!

196
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you buy a ticket and come inside,
it'll be even more amazing.

197
00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I will buy a ticket.
-Me too.

198
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We sold more tickets today than yesterday.
Your power is amazing.

199
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
TO BE CONTINUED
